# Fabricated Chat Reports
#### This is for demonstrating issues with the current reporting system only!

This mod allows you to remove context from reports in order to bring the victim *out of context*, getting them banned for having said nothing bad.  

**Example:**

![loves hypixel](https://github.com/fxmorin/FabricatedChatReports/blob/master/images/lovesHypixel.png)  

### How to use the mod
It's pretty simple. When going to the report page, you will have a button that says: `Fabricate Report` which will allow you to open the fabricate report screen.
Once in the Fabricate Report screen you will be able to change the server ip, client version, and messages to include.

*Use at your own risk!*
