# Fabricated Chat Reports
#### This is for demonstrating issues with the current reporting system only!

[![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/fxmorin/fabricatedchatreports/total?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/fxmorin/fabricatedchatreports)

This mod allows you to remove context from reports in order to bring the victim *out of context*, getting them banned for having said nothing bad.

*This version of the mod does not contain 2 other vulnerabilities of the chat report system. All vulnerabilities have been reported to Mojang*

### How to use the mod  
It's pretty simple. When going to the report page, you will have a button that says: `Fabricate Report` which will allow you to open the fabricate report screen.  
Once in the Fabricate Report screen you will be able to change the server ip, client version, and messages to include.  
  
*Use at your own risk!*  
  
### Exploits this shows:
- Ability to remove messages from the context  
- Ability to modify context sent by you  
- Ability to copy message data from one server and paste it into a report on another server (or the same server)
