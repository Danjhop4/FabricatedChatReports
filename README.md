# Fabricated Chat Reports
#### This is for demonstrating issues with the current reporting system only!

This mod allows you to remove context from reports in order to bring the victim *out of context*, getting them banned for having said nothing bad.

*The public version of the mod does not contain the 3 other vulnerabilities of the chat report system, as that may cause more chaos than im willing to take the blame for xD*

**Example:** *All messages start with a checkmark*

### How to use the mod
It's pretty simple. When going to the report page, you will have a button that says: `Fabricate Report` which will allow you to open the fabricate report screen.
Once in the Fabricate Report screen you will be able to change the server ip, client version, and messages to include.

*Use at your own risk!*
